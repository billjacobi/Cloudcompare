We are building a series of apps on Amazon AWS, Microsoft Windows Azure, and Google Compute Engine to compare the capabilities and limits of each cloud platform.

We are building a series of benchmark style apps to test the limits of CPU, storage, and networking capabilities across these platforms. Our primary development language is Python because it is supported across all cloud providers and across Windows and Linux instances. Our applications will uncover the performance and reliability limits of the underlying platforms, and, along the way, we will post our observations about our experiences in leveraging the platforms.

Oure code is stored in the winscale and linscale repos.
